\begin{theorem}\label{theo:ame_nizk}
    Let $\Pi', \sig, \nizk$ be as above.
    If $\Pi'$ is CPA private, $\sig$ is EUF-CMA secure and $\nizk$ satisfies true-simulation extractability for $f(\sattr, \signature, \raccess, \msg, r) = (\sattr, \signature, \raccess, \msg)$, then the ME scheme $\Pi$ from construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk} is CCA-secure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We can separately prove the two properties, by using Lemma~\ref{lemma:ame_auth} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:ame_priv}.
    Since we have shown that Construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk} achieves both CCA-privacy and CCA-authenticity, we have concluded the proof.
