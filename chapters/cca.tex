\chapter{Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks Security}
In this chapter we extend the security definitions of an ME to the setting of chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA).
As in the original definition, security is defined via two properties: privacy and authenticity.

\section{Privacy}\label{sec:cca-privacy}
We want privacy to capture secrecy of the sender's inputs (i.e., the attributes $\sattr$, the policy for the receiver $\raccess$, and the plaintext $\msg$), in two different scenarios: in case of a match between the sender's and receiver's attributes/policy, and in case of mismatch.
More formally, we require that the distributions $\enc(\ek_{\sattr_0}, \raccess_0, \msg_0)$ and $\enc(\ek_{\sattr_1}, \raccess_1, \msg_1)$ are computationally indistinguishable to the eyes of an attacker with oracle access to $\skgen$, $\rkgen$, $\polgen$, where the values $(m_0, m_1,\raccess_0, \raccess_1, \sattr_0, \sattr_1)$ are all chosen by the adversary.
In order to exclude some trivial attacks, it is necessary to quantify privacy over all valid adversaries, as explained in \cite{Ateniese}.
\newline\newline
In this thesis, we aim at extending the power and the flexibility of the attacker, providing an oracle access to $\dec(\dk_\rattr, \dk_\saccess, \cipher)$, where the input is controlled by the attacker: clearly, we need to exclude the trivial attack of exploiting the oracle to directly decrypt the challenge chipertext\footnote{This is standard in CCA games definitions.}.
We introduce the formal definition of CCA privacy below for ME (Definition \ref{def:me_priv}) and A-ME too (Definition \ref{def:ame_priv}).

\input{chapters/cca/ame/priv-def}

\section{Authenticity}\label{sec:cca-auth}
Authenticity, instead, demands that the only way to produce a valid ciphertext under sender attributes $\sattr$ is to obtain an encryption key $ek_\sattr$ from the authority, thus guaranteeing that if a ciphertext decrypts correctly, then it has been created by a sender with the proper encryption key. This captures security against malicious senders and is modeled by a game in which the attacker has oracle access to $\skgen$, $\rkgen$, and $\polgen$.
The attacker's goal is to output a tuple $(\rattr, \saccess, \cipher)$ such that $\dec(dk_\rattr, \dk_\saccess, \cipher) \not= \bot$, and none of the encryption keys $ek_\sattr$ for attributes $\sattr$ (obtained by the adversary via oracle queries) satisfies the policy $\saccess$.
\newline\newline
The adversary is now given access to an encryption oracle: given in input sender attributes $\sattr$, a policy $\raccess$ and a message $m$, the attacker can compute an honestly generated ciphertext $\cipher$, without the need to obtain an encryption key $\ek_\sattr$ from the authority.
We clearly need to avoid trivial attacks: we do not allow the attacker to return as challenge ciphertext one provided by the oracle.
We introduce the formal definition of CCA privacy below for ME (Definition \ref{def:me_auth}) and A-ME too (Definition \ref{def:ame_auth}).

\section{CPA to CCA Transformation}\label{sec:cca-transformation}
We are going to define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a first black-box transformation from CPA to CCA privacy, while preserving the authenticity
    \item a second black-box transformation from CPA to CCA authenticity, while preserving privacy
\end{itemize}
~\newline
It is evident that in order to achieve CCA security, we can simply apply both of these transformations in sequence: however, for sake of convenience, we will present a more efficient one which directly achieves both CCA privacy and CCA authenticity.
Figure \ref{fig:constr} gives a visual representation of the transformations presented in this thesis, explaining how to achieve CCA.

\newline\newline
The starting point for our transformations are the following constructions, based on Digital Signatures and NIZK.
\input{chapters/cca/me/construction.tex}
\input{chapters/cca/ame/construction.tex}
~\newline
We also give two simple variants which do not require any Signatures Scheme.
\input{chapters/cca/me/construction-priv.tex}
\input{chapters/cca/ame/construction-priv.tex}
~\newline
The correctness of all the previous schemes follows directly by the correctness of the underlying ME (resp. A-ME) schemes.

\subsection{CCA privacy}\label{sec:cca-priv-transformation}
We define a black-box construction to transform any CPA-private ME scheme into a CCA-private ME scheme, using construction~\ref{constr:me_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/me/priv-transformation.tex}
~\newline
In order to achieve CCA-private A-ME schemes, we can rely on construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk} and define the following transormation.
\input{chapters/cca/ame/priv-transformation.tex}

\subsection{CCA authenticity}\label{sec:cca-auth-transformation}
We define a black-box construction to achieve CCA-authenticity, using construction~\ref{constr:me_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/me/auth-transformation.tex}
~\newline
We present here how to achieve CCA-authenticity for A-ME, using construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/ame/auth-transformation.tex}

\subsection{Direct Transformation}\label{sec:cca-full-transformation}
We now define a black-box construction to transform any CPA-secure ME scheme into a CCA-secure ME scheme, by relying on construction~\ref{constr:me_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/me/full-constr.tex}
~\newline
For A-ME schemes we can do the same, using again construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk} as starting point.
