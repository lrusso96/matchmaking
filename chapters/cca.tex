\chapter{Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks Security}

In this chapter we extend the security definitions of an ME to the setting of chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA).
As in the original definition, security is defined via two properties: privacy and authenticity.

\section{Privacy}\label{sec:cca-privacy}
We want privacy to capture secrecy of the sender's inputs (i.e., the attributes $\sattr$, the policy for the receiver $\raccess$, and the plaintext $\msg$), in two different scenarios: in case of a match between the sender's and receiver's attributes/policy, and in case of mismatch.
More formally, we require that the distributions $\enc(\ek_{\sattr_0}, \raccess_0, \msg_0)$ and $\enc(\ek_{\sattr_1}, \raccess_1, \msg_1)$ are computationally indistinguishable to the eyes of an attacker with oracle access to $\skgen$, $\rkgen$, $\polgen$, where the values $(m_0, m_1,\raccess_0, \raccess_1, \sattr_0, \sattr_1)$ are all chosen by the adversary.
In order to exclude some trivial attacks, it is necessary to quantify privacy over all valid adversaries, as explained in \cite{Ateniese}.
\newline\newline
In this thesis, we aim at extending the power and the flexibility of the attacker, providing an oracle access to $\dec(\dk_\rattr, \dk_\saccess, \cipher)$, where the input is controlled by the attacker: clearly, we need to exclude the trivial attack of exploiting the oracle to directly decrypt the challenge chipertext\footnote{This is standard in CCA games definitions.}.
We introduce the formal definition of CCA privacy below for ME (Definition \ref{def:me_priv}) and A-ME too (Definition \ref{def:ame_priv}).

\section{Authenticity}\label{sec:cca-auth}
Authenticity, instead, demands that the only way to produce a valid ciphertext under sender attributes $\sattr$ is to obtain an encryption key $ek_\sattr$ from the authority, thus guaranteeing that if a ciphertext decrypts correctly, then it has been created by a sender with the proper encryption key. This captures security against malicious senders and is modeled by a game in which the attacker has oracle access to $\skgen$, $\rkgen$, and $\polgen$.
The attacker's goal is to output a tuple $(\rattr, \saccess, \cipher)$ such that $\dec(dk_\rattr, \dk_\saccess, \cipher) \not= \bot$, and none of the encryption keys $ek_\sattr$ for attributes $\sattr$ (obtained by the adversary via oracle queries) satisfies the policy $\saccess$.
\newline\newline
The adversary is now given access to an encryption oracle: given in input sender attributes $\sattr$, a policy $\raccess$ and a message $m$, the attacker can compute an honestly generated ciphertext $\cipher$, without the need to obtain an encryption key $\ek_\sattr$ from the authority.
We clearly need to avoid trivial attacks: we do not allow the attacker to return as challenge ciphertext one provided by the oracle.
We introduce the formal definition of CCA privacy below for ME (Definition \ref{def:me_auth}) and A-ME too (Definition \ref{def:ame_auth}).

\section{CPA to CCA Transformation}\label{sec:cca-transformation}

We are going to define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a first black-box transformation from CPA to CCA privacy, while preserving the authenticity
    \item a second black-box transformation from CPA to CCA authenticity, while preserving privacy
\end{itemize}
~\newline
It is evident that in order to achieve CCA security, we can simply apply both of these transformations in sequence: however, for sake of convenience, we will present a more efficient one which directly achieves both CCA privacy and CCA authenticity.
\newline\newline
The starting point for our transformations are the following constructions, based on Digital Signatures and NIZK.
\input{chapters/cca/me/construction.tex}
\input{chapters/cca/ame/construction.tex}

\subsection{CCA privacy}
We define a black-box construction to transform any CPA-private ME scheme into a CCA-private ME scheme, using construction~\ref{constr:me_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/me/priv-construction.tex}
~\newline
In order to achieve CCA-private A-ME schemes, we can rely on construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk} and define the following transormation.
\input{chapters/cca/ame/priv-construction.tex}

\subsection{CCA authenticity}
We define a black-box construction to achieve CCA-authenticity, using construction~\ref{constr:me_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/me/auth-construction.tex}
~\newline
We present here how to achieve CCA-authenticity for A-ME, using construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/ame/auth-construction.tex}

\subsection{Direct Transformation}
We now define a black-box construction to transform any CPA-secure ME scheme into a CCA-secure ME scheme, by relying on construction~\ref{constr:me_nizk}.
\input{chapters/cca/me/full-constr.tex}
~\newline
For A-ME schemes we can do the same, using again construction~\ref{constr:ame_nizk} as starting point.
